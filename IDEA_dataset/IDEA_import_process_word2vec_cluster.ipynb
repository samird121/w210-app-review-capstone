      "1 they remove the skip 10 second forward and backwards by double tap each end of the screen . first of all , now if i miss what a person say , it be extremely hard to go back . second , it's already hard enough to scrub on an iphone , so remove this essentially make me watch the entire video . youtube , don't worry . i'll still be watch your video , but i don't want to watch trash video . either way , the second major problem pour salt in the wound . 2 they add three suggest video to the bottom of the screen while you're watch the video . now , whenever you go to tap the scrub bar , you have 90 10 odds of accidentally start a different video instead of simply be able to scrub through the video . this be absolutely unacceptable and youtube must change now .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "now everytime you slightly touch either side of the screen well watch a video it jump forward or backwards 10 second , this make it very hard to hold my phone while watch a video , and when i try to click the information button to see relate video or change the setting it start mess up my video . this make watch very choppy and annoy . i don't know why they would get rid of the button that be next to the play button that you could actually see . it be ruin watch video on my phone .\n",

      "improve slightly with video buffer pause . now it lock itself into landscape mode when i leave a video . have to leave the app and come back for it to be fix . also , it skip through my offline video . won't play one after another . no i don't have shuffle on . lastly , the video suggestion box under the buffer bar in video be super distract and there's no reason for them . please work on this guy ! although i love the 10 second skip feature . but i suggest a set switch to turn it off as some people don't seem to like it .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in fact this be the first review i've make in year . but seriously , the update be horrible . the home screen thumbnail be way too big and take up the whole screen . the new autoplay feature be terrible , please make it so if we have to have autoplay , there's not the previous video and next video button on the screen . if i'm in the middle of a video and i accidentally happen to tap one of those button , it take me away from the video i be just watch and to whatever's up next on autoplay . which mean i have to go back to what i be just watch , wait for the ad to finish , and then skip to where i be in the video . it's such a headache jfc fix your sh tty app .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "usually i don't like layout change because i don't like change in general but this update be simply just inconvenient . i can't go back to the begin or end of the video without go in 10 second interval because my phone have a case on it and i can't reach close enough to the edge of my screen . advertisement do not need a the thumbnail on the side as if it be give you the opinion to skip it . advertisement do not need video thumbnail even when you have the option to skip it . it simply take up too much space on my screen . the 10 second interval need button for themselves instead of be a double tap . i like the feature but it be inconvenient because when i'm try to skip part in video it end up switch between 10 second interval .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "no . nononono this update need to disappear , first off i don't like the fact that when i tap on screen it take 2 second for it to actually pop up with the pause and prev next , second when my phone be flip up vertically i can't swipe the video all the way back because the start be so far to the leave , third all of the button take 2 second as well to actually take action , and fourth of all i can't even flip my phone horizontally to make the video change position . great update really . sarcasm .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "with the new ten second skip and rewind thing , i actually think that it's a good idea . it really add some precision that be need especially in longer video where drag the timer microscopically could have potentially send the video fly ahead or behind by minute . of course there be an issue when the phone be in it tilt full screen mode where i try and leave full screen only to fast forward the video . maybe make the interface a little larger . also there be a rise issue where the video won't load and keep say an error occur .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "first off , the 10 second idea itself be not bad . i like the idea of rewinding back a few second . the terrible implementation be the double tap of one entire half of the screen . see , when i'm a little bore if the video be repetitive or something , i rapidly tap the right side of the screen just to see the button appear and disappear . now when i do that it advance like a minute forward , which be horribly annoy . what would fix this be have the two function as small button like the pause play or the previous next video . this be feature need fix the most . second off , on short video or if i want to re watch a video , i , as a normal person would , scroll back the video to the begin . the problem be that with this update , it's nearly impossible . the scroll bar take up the whole screen length when in miniature mode , mean that i can't reach the far leave side . this be horribly annoy as well . this then force me to rewind to a bite after the begin and then have to use the 10 second feature which be already something i've complain about . overall , this update be terrible and i regret not read the review before update .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i don't know what people be complain about with the update . the ability to skip 10 second forward or back be great ! it doesn't interfere with tap the screen to see the time leave at all . different tab be great instead of swipe for each one . every once in a blue moon a video will stop and the audio will continue to play if you switch between landscape or portrait but overall i love the change .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i enjoy the app and use it at least an hour or so a day but the new feature to where you swipe up for other video be annoy . it's constantly in the way and it pop up when i don't even touch the screen or it come up when i'm try to fast forward or rewind and i end up unintentionally hit it try to do something else . please make an option to turn it off .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i use youtube all the time . but this new update make me not want to use it . it refresh everytime i exit not quit the app and then go back into it . sometimes i pause a video to check a message and then i'll open it up and it completely refresh . i find this very irritate . as well , when my finger be scroll the video up , it'll hit s thumbnail and it'll flash grayish and it be jolt . it actually make me anxious . i don't particularly appreciate see s flash gray thing on my screen without warn . i do like be able to go back 10 second or go forward 10 second but the mechanic of it be horrible . i be try to press pause and it go back . i be try to hit full screen and it go forward . it's annoy .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "now it's hard to tap thing during video . when you tap the screen anywhere there be not a button it create a ripple effect , which be just pointless . it make it even harder to close suggestion . ad be harder to skip . just fix this before i just go back to watch youtube on pc .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i like it better before the recent update . the video lag out and keep pause when i don't want it to . i can't slide the slider the timeline button for skip or rewinding the video to where i want it to smoothly anymore . it move so roughly .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the app be okay before , but the recent change that show three relate video at the bottom when you tap the screen be quite annoy . it take me 2 5 try agh time to rewind the video if i miss something , and sometimes i accidentally tap the video and lose the one i be currently watch . i don't really see much of a point , especially since to access those video you can simply turn the screen sideways . anyways , minor problem , but it should probably be remove .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the skip forward and backward 10 second in neat , but why have that when i can easily scroll back to the exact point i need with the window feature . why make the video length bar so small when hold my phone vertical . now i have to try for five minute to either correctly tap on the right point in the video because my thumb be too big , and i'm only 16 . this be ridiculous , there be no point to change what be fine , just let us have annotation and video speed , thank .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "with the addition of the useless 10 second and 10 second button i'm assume their button watch video , check how far in to the video you be , and maximize minimize and all other button on the screen during a video have become much more annoy . this be all because the new 10 second button be annoy . i'll try to maximize the video and poof 10 second , i'll try to edit the video quality and poof 10 second , or i just want to quickly check how far into the video i be by quickly tap the screen twice so as to see time and them make it go away . poof 10 second in the video . the 10 second button be also not useful . i mean really though i can see it for go back to rewatch a funny scene but that be it ! and you still dont need the button to do that ! ultimately i hope that this either become an option or be take away .\n",

      "\n",
      "the you app hand a lot ahead for it but somethings need to be fix the next video button be place wrong so when since i have big finger instead of press play i press the forward button and another thing be rat when there be like a minute leave it skip to the end and i can't see the rest it get quiet annoy .\n",

      "\n",
      "can no longer stream to my tv or xbox . the stream button no longer show at all . everything they change with the update be terrible ! my watch later wont show all my video until i add one to it then they all reappear . then when i close the app to do something else really quick it loss my place the video i be watch and just send me to the open screen . it awful . fix the watch later playlist ! reverse the order ! put the latest video add at the top not the bottom . it be so annoy have to scroll down all the way every time also when i remove a video it take me all the way back to the top . extremely annoy .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the volume bar at the top be really nice , but there be a lot of new annoy bug . most of the video in my sub box have the white watch filter on them without the watch text even though i haven't touch the video , whenever there be outro card the video just skip straight to the end as soon as they be present , the video and audio tend to get desynced , and the share and add to playlist button stay on the screen unless i manually tap twice to remove them .\n",

      "i like the app but the new update have ruin many thing . in my subscription tab all the video say i have watch them even though i have not click on many of the video . video freeze at a certain frame and the audio continue on . then if i try rewinding the video to fix this the video skip to a random point much later in the video ex i be watch a video that freeze around two minute in the video . i try rewinding to about 1 30 . the video then skip to around four minute into the video and refuse to rewind or fast forward to any other point until i close the video . these didn't happen before i update the app . also autotube be a good thing if i choose to watch a playlist . i'm not watch a playlist . i be click on singular video . it be good you can turn this feature off , but the arrow remain . it be easy to accidentally press these button and skip the video i actually choose to watch . this be extremely enrage . if you refuse to completely get rid of this feature at least make it optional in setting to remove it . base on similar review i've read many people would like this option .\n",
