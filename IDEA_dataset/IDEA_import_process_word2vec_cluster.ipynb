      "over a year later and my review of this junk app have hardly change . an obvious sign that the developer don't care about the app . a huge money leach spy company like google sure have the cash to do much better than this cheaply slat together app . sad ! do i sound harsh ? i have no petty for a company that be worth billion of dollar by sell private information of their client to market company and then provide the people they spy on with poorly develop apps such as this one , map , and the list go on . how can a guy by himself develop a better app than this one in his basement , while this huge corporation can't ? seriously , there be no excuse . none ! i hate the fact that this app doesn't have a back button . a lot of time i wish i could go back to the previous page video to click on another one of the suggest video that show up . you can do that in a web browser or some other apps and i can't understand why you can't do it in this app . no logical reason what so ever except for poor development result a cheaply put together app . developer need to go back to school . leave a comment be annoy . the box the pop up to type your message should be larger . it doesn't even work right . again the whole apps need improvement . for a little while i've notice a huge increase in the number of ad before a video . that be even more true when watch video from a computer . the number of ad and their length be get way too excessive . to a level of ridiculous . for a moment i think it be my imagination , but everything make sense with the announcement of youtube red . the greedy folk at youtube want to annoy the hell out of people in order to encourage them to pay for an over price service . hell , at 13 buck per month , youtube in more expensive than netflix , my local basic cable , and other tv and web service . their fame and greed have really get to their head . therefore i give this app and the youtube as a company one star . i would give it a negative 5 if i could .\n",
