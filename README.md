Introduction 


Data

For this product demo, we chose to analyze Viber app reviews from the Google Play Store.  First, clean, analyze reviews to find important topics. This includes unsupervised methods for automatic topic clustering, and keyword detection.  And then, map emerging “topics” back to “notable” reviews that contain useful information.


Lessons Learned

K-means cluster: 

PCoA 
Principle Coordinate Analysis is a method to explore and to visualize similarities or dissimilarities of data. It starts with a similarity matrix or dissimilarity matrix and assigns for each item a location in a low-dimensional space. By using PCoA we can visualize individual and/or group differences.
